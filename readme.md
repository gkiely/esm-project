The goal of this project was to create a buildless application using web components that has JSDoc type checking.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used for the dev server and can be used to bundle, but is not necessary.
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is used for the UI library.
- [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html) plugin is used for syntax highlighting
- This code can be uploaded to a server and it will work without a build step or transpilation.
